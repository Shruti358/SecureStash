# SecureStash

A React Native application for secure password and credential management with a modern, user-friendly interface.

## üì± Features

- **User Authentication**: Signup and Login screens with secure password handling
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with green-themed branding
- **Navigation**: Smooth screen transitions using React Navigation
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Android and iOS

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 20 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **React Native CLI** - Install globally: `npm install -g @react-native-community/cli`
- **Android Studio** (for Android development) - [Download here](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- **Xcode** (for iOS development, macOS only) - Available on Mac App Store
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** - Version 17 or higher
- **Android SDK** - Install via Android Studio

## üìã Installation Steps

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Shruti358/SecureStash
cd SecureStash

# If you're working with a specific branch
git checkout <branch-name>
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

## Backend (Firebase) Setup

This app uses Firebase Auth, Firestore, Storage, and Cloud Functions.

Prereqs:
- Node 20+
- Firebase CLI installed and logged in

Steps:
1) Create a Firebase project in the Console. Enable Authentication (Email/Password), Firestore, and Storage.
2) Put your Android google-services.json into `android/app/google-services.json` (already present) and iOS GoogleService-Info.plist into Xcode project if building for iOS.
3) Set your project ID in `.firebaserc` and in `config/backend.ts` (FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID).
4) Deploy rules and functions:
    - Install function deps and build:
       - cd functions && npm install && npm run build
    - From project root:
       - firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage:rules,functions

Local emulation:
- firebase emulators:start

Frontend usage:
- Use helpers in `components/backendClient.ts` to call callable functions and HTTP endpoint.

Data model and rules: see `Backend-Schema.md`.

```bash
# Install all npm dependencies
npm install
```

**Note**: If you encounter any JSON parsing errors during installation, check the `package.json` file for syntax errors (like trailing commas).

### Step 3: Install React Native Dependencies

The project requires additional React Native dependencies for navigation:

```bash
# Install React Navigation dependencies
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack

# Install required native dependencies
npm install react-native-screens react-native-gesture-handler react-native-safe-area-context
```

### Step 4: Android Setup

#### 4.1 Configure Android Environment

1. **Set up Android SDK**:
   - Open Android Studio
   - Go to Settings/Preferences ‚Üí Appearance & Behavior ‚Üí System Settings ‚Üí Android SDK
   - Install Android SDK Platform 34 (API Level 34)
   - Install Android SDK Build-Tools 34.0.0

2. **Set Environment Variables** (Windows):
   ```bash
   # Add these to your system environment variables
   ANDROID_HOME=C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
   PATH=%PATH%;%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools
   PATH=%PATH%;%ANDROID_HOME%\tools
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables** (macOS/Linux):
   ```bash
   # Add to your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zshrc
   export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
   export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
   ```

#### 4.2 Create Android Virtual Device (AVD)

1. Open Android Studio
2. Go to Tools ‚Üí AVD Manager
3. Click "Create Virtual Device"
4. Select a device (e.g., Pixel 9a)
5. Select a system image (e.g., API 34)
6. Click "Finish"

### Step 5: iOS Setup (macOS only)

```bash
# Install iOS dependencies
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

## üöÄ Running the Application

### Option 1: Run on Android

```bash
# Start the Metro bundler (in a separate terminal)
npx react-native start

# In another terminal, run the Android app
npx react-native run-android
```

**Alternative (single command)**:
```bash
# This will start Metro and run the app
npx react-native run-android
```

### Option 2: Run on iOS (macOS only)

```bash
# Start the Metro bundler (in a separate terminal)
npx react-native start

# In another terminal, run the iOS app
npx react-native run-ios
```

**Alternative (single command)**:
```bash
# This will start Metro and run the app
npx react-native run-ios
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Metro Bundler Port Already in Use
```bash
# Kill the process using port 8081
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

#### 2. Android Build Errors
```bash
# Clean the Android build
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
npx react-native run-android
```

#### 3. React Navigation ViewManager Errors
If you see errors like "Can't find ViewManager 'RNSScreenStackHeaderConfig'", ensure you have:
- Installed `react-native-screens` and `react-native-gesture-handler`
- Updated `MainActivity.kt` with the `onCreate` override
- Wrapped your app with `GestureHandlerRootView`

#### 4. Dependencies Not Found
```bash
# Clear npm cache and reinstall
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

#### 5. Android Emulator Not Starting
- Ensure Android Studio is properly configured
- Check that AVD is created and working
- Verify environment variables are set correctly

### Build Warnings

You may see CMake warnings about long file paths during the build process. These are common on Windows and don't affect the app's functionality.

=======
This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes ‚Äî¬†this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
